# Travelling Sales Person problem

Solving Travelling Salesman Problem using Approximation and Brute force. We make use of the algorithm stated in “Introduction to Algorithms”
by Cormen,Lieserson, Rivest and Stein.

<li> Reads the csv file and filters records based on input dates
<li> Generate graph from the data parsed
<li> Generate prim's MST of graph
<li> Generate preorder waslk of MST and find Hamiltonian cycle in that order.
<li> We also look at the brute force approach by inspecting all possible routes.
 
 ## Sample output for dates (1/1/90 and 1/1/90) would look like:
